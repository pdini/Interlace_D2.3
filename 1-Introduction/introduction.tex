The final architecture of the INTERLACE platform can be understood to refer to three different systems. First, it is the architecture that was implemented as reported in deliverable D3.2 \cite{INTERLACE_D32}; second, it is the architecture of the whole Sardex application, which includes the INTERLACE, blockchain-based transactional platform as one of its microservices; and, third, it is the long-term open shared architecture vision of the overall system as it scales to many countries and jurisdictions. 

This report describes briefly all three, and concludes with some reflections on the role of a responsible and critical engineering approach towards the design and development of an inclusive, open, and shared infrastructure layer as the main legacy of the INTERLACE project.
